So yeah, gonna start on the ARENA program ... again. This will contain my notes and thoughts going through this program. 

Why is getting going so damn hard?! ... Is it because I have this thought of getting started then fading is my experience to date??

Today I forked https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0 to https://github.com/rkaunismaa/ARENA_3.0. 

I am also going to use Claude in this process to discover how it can be useful to my understanding.

OK. So I asked Github Copilot to help me with the exercises in 0.1_Ray_Tracing_exercises.ipynb and write the solutions to a new notebook file called 0.1_Ray_Tracing_exercises_GithubCopilot.ipynb.

I then asked Claude Code to do the same thing and write to 0.1_Ray_Tracing_exercises_Claude.ipynb.

I will compare the two solutions and see how they differ.
